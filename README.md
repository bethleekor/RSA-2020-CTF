Materials and references for RSA 2020 talk "Everyone Can Play!"

Workshop activites require local Docker and/or free [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) account. Local execution of utility scripts requires [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/).

To perform command line configuration of Heroku install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).

To prepare in advance, clone the this repository and the below repositories. If you will be working using local Docker you can build both the CTFd Docker Compose definition and the OWASP Juice Shop Docker image.
